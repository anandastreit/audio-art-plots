# audio-art-plots

## About
This project targets artists and data analysts who play with creativity when generating plots, even when the underlying data is limited. The aim is to represent data and its hidden patterns in an interesting and understandable way that appeals to the viewer's feelings.

## Current state
In this first version, possibilities of shapes and colors in audio data spectrograms are experimented by changing a few and simple parameters, such as sampling rate and color maps. The result of these experiments has already generated artworks like the one in the image below.
